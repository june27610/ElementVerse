                <ul>
                    <li>To provide easy access to information about all chemical elements — including their symbols, atomic numbers, and properties.</li>
                    <li>To help students and learners understand the organization of the periodic table, such as groups, periods, and element categories (metals, nonmetals, metalloids, etc.).</li>
                    <li>To serve as a quick reference tool for students, teachers, and science enthusiasts.</li>
                    <li>To make chemistry learning more interactive and engaging through color coding, hover effects, or clickable elements that show details.</li>
                    <li>To promote curiosity and deeper exploration of how elements relate to real-world uses and discoveries.</li>

                <details>
                    <summary>Why is the periodic table called “periodic”?</summary>
                    <p>It is called periodic because the properties of elements repeat at regular intervals, or periods, when arranged by increasing atomic number.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Who created the periodic table?</summary>
                    <p>The periodic table was first developed by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869.
                        He arranged elements according to their atomic mass and left spaces for elements that had not yet been discovered.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>How are elements arranged in the periodic table?</summary>
                    <p>Elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number (number of protons).
                        They are organized in rows called periods and columns called groups based on similar chemical properties.</p>
